'''This script detects images containing clouds and saves images WITHOUT clouds to a separate folder.
The script applies a threshold to segment cloud regions in the image. 
It then calculates the percentage of cloud pixels in the image and compares it to a threshold value. 
Adjust the threshold percentage based on your specific requirements.
